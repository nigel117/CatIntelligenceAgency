<h2>Description</h2>
This Project serves as a secure Web Information System running on a locally hosted Apache Tomcat server. The project was created using JSP and Java Servlets. Beyond basic web design, this project also implements some more advanced security measures. This project was a fun blend of both web design and web security, both of which I was a bit unfamiliar with, making the project all the more valuable.
<br />
<h2> Security Requirements </h2>

- <b>The user has to log in using userID and password</b>

- <b>After closing the browser, the user cannot get into the secured Web information system without logging in again</b>
